    <h1>2023 Movie Rankings</h1>
    <h2>My ranking of the movies I have seen in 2023</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>1. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
    <p>Man, this movie was amazing. The animation and plot was impressive. I can't wait for Beyond. I just hope Beyond will be made with better working conditions.</p>
    <h3>2. Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</h3>
    <p>Fun movie, fun cast, great representation of the game.</p>
    <h3>3. The Super Mario Bros. Movie</h3>
    <p>Fun film. Jack Black as Bowser was amazing. The nihilistic Luma was fun. My favorite moment was the Double Rider Kick at the end by Mario and Luigi.</p>
    <h3>4. Five Nights at Freddy's</h3>
    <p>Okay film. Not bad, perfectly fine use of its source materials. Matthew Lillard's William Afton was fun, despite not having much screentime.</p>
